# GameOfLife
My implementation of the world famous Conway's 'Game Of Life'. I wrote it in C because it was a school project for a friend, maybe later I will update it so it will be written in C++. It doesn't need any external libraries nor anything weird. You only need a file containing the initial state and the console! I provide a couple of example for testing the program. Hope you like it and hoping it will help you if you were looking for a straightforward implementation.
